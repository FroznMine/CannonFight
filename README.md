# CannonFight #

A game plugin for Minecraft Bukkit Servers using LobbySystem


CannonFight is about fighting with different cannons all having unique effects. For example there is the FireballCannon which shoots a fireball which in turn will create an explosion at the location it detonates. Of course the damage made to your opponents can be increased by upgrading your cannon.
